CMC wants to focus on finding an optimal route to transport the excess food to different drop off points. They want to have a vehicle pick up excess food from one location and then drop it off to various locations. To do this, we will be keeping track of different variables such as the addresses of the locations, the distance between the locations, and the travel time it will take to arrive at each location. We will also have variables for the type of food being transferred, the food group, if the food is perishable, the spoil date, common allergens the food contains, and food quantity to make sure the food is delivered safely and efficiently.
